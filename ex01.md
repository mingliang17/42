#include <unistd>
-	provides write function

void for function that returns nothing

write(1, &c, 1);: This is a system call that writes data to a file descriptor.
write() is a low-level function (provided by unistd.h) used for writing data. It takes 3 arguments:
File Descriptor: 1 refers to the standard output (stdout). In Unix-like systems, 0 is stdin (input), 1 is stdout (output), and 2 is stderr (error).
Pointer to the Data: &c is the address of the character c. This tells the function what data to write.
Number of Bytes: 1 tells write() to write one byte from the address of c, which is the size of a char.

take note is & not % cos &c is address of c and %c is not
