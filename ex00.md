Unix Shell 00 -Old

Linux Terminal

-> pwd

displays the full path of the current working directory when executed in the terminal
-> ls -la

"-la" are options that modify the behavior of the command. The "-l" option lists files in long format, and the "-a" option shows all files, including those that start with a dot, which are typically hidden files

-> .
-> ..
." refers to the current directory, and ".." refers to the parent directory of the current directory

-> man X
get documentation of command X

-> ssh keygen
press enter x3
-> cd ~/.ssh/
-> cat id_rsa.pub

-> ~ 
goes to home/ming

->echo hello_world > hi.txt

-> touch X
creates file X

Make Backup
inside git,
-> git status
-> git add hi.txt
-> git commit -m "added hi.txt"
-> git push

-> ls -l
see permissions 

drwx-wxr-x 2  ming XX 3 Feb 10 15:25 FILENAME

2 is number of hard links
3 is bytesize
date is Feb10
time is 15:25

Permissions	Numeric	Meaning
drwxr-xr-x	755	Directory, accessible by everyone but only writable by the owner
-rw-r--r--	644	File, readable by everyone but can only be modified by the owner
-rwxrwxrwx	777	File is readable (and executable) by anybody
-rw-------	600	File can only be accessed by the owner, inaccessible to everyone else

1st code is d for directory or - for file
2-4: user
5-7: group
8-10: others
-> chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r FILENAME

-> 	tar -cf testShell00.tar testShell00
The tar -cf command in Linux is used to create a tar archive file. The -c option stands for create, and the -f option specifies the name of the output file.
create submission file


Modify Timestamp
-> touch -t yyyymmddhhmm FILENAME
where yyyymmddhhmm  is  202306012047

Modify File Size
-> truncate -s 4 FILENAME
where 4 is desired bytes size

Show Time and Date
-> ls =l --time-style=long-iso
- year will show if date older than 6 months, only 


Create Additional HardLink:
-> ln test3 test3_link

Create Hidden HardLink in Hidden Directory:
->  mkdir .hidden_directory
-> ln test5 .hidden_directory/text5_link

Create Symbolic Link Between files (lrwxrwxrwx 1 XX XX 5 Jun 1 22:20 test6 -> test0)

->ln -s <target_file> <link_name>
-> ln -s test6 test0

Specifically to edit Symbolic Link,
-> touch -h -t  20250210634 test6

Ls -t -m -p

-t (Sort by Modification Time):
Sorts files and directories by their modification time, with the most recently modified files first.
2. -m (Comma-Separated Output):
Outputs the list of files and directories as a comma-separated list instead of displaying them in multiple lines.
3. -p (Appends / to Directories):
Adds a / character at the end of each directory name, making it clear which entries are directories.
4. -a (Show hidden)



Create Script File (called gi.sh)
-> nano gi.sh
OR
-> vim gi.sh

Inside either one,
#!/bin/bash
# This script displays the IDs of the last 5 commits in the Git repository
git log -n 5 --pretty=format:"%H"

Exit with Ctl + X, Y to save

back in shell
-> chmod +x gi.sh
this  grants permission to xcute

run script:
./gi.sh OR bash gi.sh

Bash Code to show hidden files only:
git ls-files --ignored --exclude-standard --others

Bash Code to show all files including hidden ones
ls -a: Shows all files including hidden ones



diff a b > sw.diff

diff [options] file1 file2
Common Options
-u: Unified format, which shows a few lines of context around the changes, making it easier to read.
-c: Context format, similar to -u but includes more context lines.
-i: Ignores case differences.
-w: Ignores all white space.
-y: Side-by-side comparison, showing both files in parallel.
-q: Reports only if the files differ, without showing the differences.

Output Format
Lines that are different will be displayed with a symbol indicating the type of change:
<: Line appears only in the first file.
>: Line appears only in the second file.
-: Line has been removed in the second file.
+: Line has been added in the second file.

In the first row of the difference file (b)
3,5c3,7
This means:

3,5: These are the line numbers from the first file. It tells you that lines 3 to 5 in the first file are being replaced.
c: This indicates that a change (modification) occurred at this location. Other characters can include:
a for added lines.
d for deleted lines.
3,7: These are the line numbers from the second file where the change will occur. In this case, lines 3 to 7 in the second file are where the changes were made.

if you diff both the change files you should get no output

To use the diff file to update b:
patch b sw.diff

find . -type f \( -name '*~' -o -name '#*#' \) -print -delete
find .: This tells find to start searching from the current directory (.) and include all subdirectories.
-type f: This restricts the search to files only (ignoring directories, symbolic links, etc.).
\( and \): These parentheses group the conditions, ensuring that both conditions are considered together.
-name '*~': This searches for files whose names end with ~.
-o: This is the logical OR operator. It allows you to combine multiple search conditions.
-name '#*#': This searches for files whose names start and end with #.
-print : print
-delete: delete
The backslashes (\) before the parentheses are needed to escape them so that they are treated as part of the find syntax rather than special characters in the shell.

for something at 42 byte, must append at 41st byte.
Create an empty string of 41 bytes full of null (0):
head -c 41 < /dev/zero > testfile
Append "42" at 42nd byte:
echo -n "42" >> testfile
To check the created file:
xxd testfile
To run test:
file -m ft_magic testfile
(-m refers to magic file)

Inside the ft_magic file:
0   string      "42"	42 filetype
<offset> <data type>  <value><filetype>
(use tabs when creating this)

what is the correct value to input at value?

Alternatively, just spam numbers in nano till 41 bytes then type 42

41 	string	"42"	42 filetype
if you edit the 42 filetype, then you can type random things an it will show up instead when you return the file


Clarify if ex09 is try_magic or test-magic?
